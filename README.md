# Bit is the shortest way to reuse atomic components between projects

## What is Bit? ü§î

Bit is an [open-source](https://github.com/teambit/bit) cli tool for sharing components across projects and repositories. Bit removes the burden by automating the creation of a separate package for each component. Use Bit to turn a component inside an application into a standalone reusable package. 
You can set up your server for sharing components, or you can use the [bit.dev](https://bit.dev) cloud hosting solution for private and public components sharing with advanced features such as components CI and showcase.

## Why Bit? üéñÔ∏è

Bit simplifies the process of collaborating on UI components. Team members can share, maintain, and synchronize components from different projects.
This allows teams to:

- Increase code reusability
- Increase design and development efficiency
- Retain UI and UX consistency
- A stepping stone for establishing a [micro frontends architecture](https://martinfowler.com/articles/micro-frontends.html)

## Key Features üîë

- Extract a component for sharing directly from an existing project.
- Build and test each component separately from the rest of the application.
- Change the source code of shared components from any consuming project. 
- Get changes in components on top of local adjustments.
- Contribute back changes made to components directly from your project.
- Let Bit auto-generate package.json for each component
- Version each component individually.
- Automated component versioning according to changes in the dependency graph chain.
- Works alongside with Git, NPM, and Yarn.

Bit is working with Javascript and Javascript frameworks:

## bit.dev cloud üå©Ô∏è

Use [bit.dev](https://bit.dev) cloud hosting solution as a shared server and playground for your compoentns.
