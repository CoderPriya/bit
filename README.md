# Bit is the shortest way to reuse atomic components between projects

## What is Bit? ü§î

Bit is an [open-source](https://github.com/teambit/bit) cli tool for sharing components across projects and repositories. 
Use Bit to turn a component inside an application into a standalone reusable package.  
Increase the project's resilience by consuming only the components the application needs.
You can set up your own server for sharing components or you can use the [bit.dev](https://bit.dev) cloud hosting for private and public components sharing with advanced features such as components CI and components showcase.

## Why Bit? üéñÔ∏è

Bit simplifies the process of collaborating on UI components. Team members can share, maintain, and synchronize components from different projects.
This allows teams to:

- Increase code reusability
- Increase design and development efficiency
- Increase project's resilience to changes
- Retain UI and UX consistency
- A stepping stone for establishing a [micro frontends architecture](https://martinfowler.com/articles/micro-frontends.html)

## Key Features üîë

- Extract a component for sharing directly from an existing project.
- Validate the component's independence by building and testing each component separately from the rest of the application.
- Change the source code of shared components from any project that utilizes it.
- Get published changes in components on top of local modifications.
- Contribute back changes made to components directly from your project.
- Let Bit auto-generate npm package for each component.
- Distribute small atomic components instead of a bloated package.
- Automate component versioning according to changes in its dependencies.
- Use with leading frameworks and tools: React, Vue, Angular, Mocha, Jest.  
- Works alongside Git, NPM, and Yarn.

Bit is working with Javascript and Javascript frameworks:

## Installation üö™

Using npm: 

```bash
npm install bit-bin --global
```

Using yarn: 
```bash
yarn global add bit-bin  
```

Bit cli requires node 8.12 and above. Check other [installation](https://docs.bit.dev/docs/installation) methods.

## bit.dev cloud üå©Ô∏è

Use [bit.dev](https://bit.dev) cloud hosting solution as a shared server and playground for your components.
